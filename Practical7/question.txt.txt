Q: Plot a boxplot of total case numbers in different countries on 14 March 2020.

Question is addressed from line 44.

I made a boxplot of total case numbers in different countries on 2020/3/14. 
Data of most countries are concentrated, but some countries had a huge number of total case that day.
